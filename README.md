# MazeSolvingAlgorithm
Depth First Search algorithm of a nxn matrix to escape from a maze

Input is n by n matrix where:

integer 1 represents walls

integer 2 is the starting point

integer 3 is the destination (so this is what we are looking for)

integer 0 represents the states we can consider (so the solution contains one or more 0 states)
